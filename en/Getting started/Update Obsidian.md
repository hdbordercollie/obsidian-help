Obsidian's updating process is different on mobile and desktop devices.

Obsidian on desktop devices regularly checks for new updates. If automatic updates are enabled, the application will update on restart. Obsidian needs periodic [[#Installer updates|installer updates]], which require downloading and running the installer.

On mobile devices, Obsidian is updated through the device's app store. The installer version is the same as the app version. Obsidian does not feature auto-update.

## Check for updates and view version

Open **Settings → General**.

You can find the app and installer version at the top of the page, under **App**.

To check for updates, select **Check for updates**. If there are new updates, Obsidian will offer to relaunch. Select **Relaunch** to apply any available updates.

## Disable automatic updates

If you prefer to update Obsidian manually, you can disable automatic updates.

1. Open **Settings → General**.
2. Disable **Automatic updates**.

## Installer updates

On desktop, Obsidian's [release notes](https://obsidian.md/changelog/) will sometimes indicate that you need to update the installer version of Obsidian. This is the version of Electron, the framework on which Obsidian is built, and cannot be updated by the automatic update process. 

A community plugin or theme may require an installer update to access newer features that are not available in older versions of Electron, and may ask you to update the installer version of Obsidian before Obsidian itself asks.

To update the installer version of Obsidian:

1. Navigate to https://obsidian.md/download.
2. Select the **Download** button.
3. Close Obsidian, if open.
4. Proceed as detailed in [[Download and install Obsidian]].

Your installer update is now complete.

> You **do not** need to uninstall Obsidian to update the installer version.
